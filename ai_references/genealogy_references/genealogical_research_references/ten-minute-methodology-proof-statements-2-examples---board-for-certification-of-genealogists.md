![](https://bcgcertification.org/images/springboard/IMG_2457.jpg)This post is part of an occasional series intended to educate and challenge BCG associates, aspirants, and the genealogical community at large.  
  
  
  
[**I promised last post to give examples of *proof statements*.**](https://bcgcertification.org/ten-minute-methodology-proof-statements-1/) Here are two. The first shows proof statements as sentences, the second as data items.  
  
**Proof statements in a genealogical summary**. Here each proof statement is comprised of an assertion and its related source citations, together proving the identity of Harriet and her husband. The sources are original and the context demonstrates “reasonably exhaustive research” in vital, church, and newspaper records. Two proof statements in this excerpt show the relationship of Harriet and Joseph to the parents of each.  
  
**1\. Harriet Jane Iddiols** , daughter of John Iddiols and Harriet Walter, was born 1 November 1842 in London, England,1 and died 3 April 1881 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.2 She married on 13 February 1863 at Saint John to **Joseph Williams**.3 Joseph, son of Peter and Elizabeth Williams, was baptized 27 November 1836 at Mawgan-in-Meneage, Cornwall, England,4 and died 24 April 1886 in Boston, Massachusetts.5

**Proof statements in a database**. Here the proof statements are not sentences, but data items, a series of related proofs for the events of a woman’s life. Each is supported by at least one citation to a high quality source. Taken together they create context for evidence of this woman’s identity.  
  
Two items assert Philippina’s relationship to her father and her mother. Again, each is supported by direct evidence from original sources and some primary information. Using a relationship tag or fact allows us to identify all the sources that bear directly on proof of parentage. If our genealogy software does not provide such tags, we can create them.

**Did you notice** how the proof statements in these examples comply with the [Genealogical Proof Standard](https://bcgcertification.org/ethics/ethics-standards/) (except for resolution of conflicting evidence, as there is none)?

**Next time** we’ll look at what our proof looks like when there ***is*** conflicting evidence.
