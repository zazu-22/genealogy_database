# Temporal values

CypherÂ® has built-in support for handling temporal values, which can be stored as properties on nodes and relationships in Neo4j databases. This section will discuss how Cypher handles time zones, before exploring temporal values in more detail.

*   Refer to [Temporal functions - instant types](../../functions/temporal/) for information regarding temporal _functions_ allowing for the creation and manipulation of temporal values.
    
*   Refer to [Temporal operators](../../expressions/temporal-operators/) for information regarding temporal _operators_.
    
*   Refer to [Equality, ordering, and comparison of value types](../ordering-equality-comparison/) for information regarding the comparison and ordering of temporal values.
    

## [](#_temporal_value_types)Temporal value types

The following table lists the temporal value types and their supported components:

   

Type

Date support

Time support

Time zone support

`DATE`

`LOCAL TIME`

`ZONED TIME`

`LOCAL DATETIME`

`ZONED DATETIME`

`DURATION`

`-`

`-`

`-`

`DATE`, `LOCAL TIME`, `ZONED TIME`, `LOCAL DATETIME`, and `ZONED DATETIME` are _temporal instant_ types. A temporal instant value expresses a point in time with varying degrees of precision.

By contrast, `DURATION` is not a temporal instant type. A `DURATION` represents a temporal amount, capturing the difference in time between two instants, and can be negative. `DURATION` captures the amount of time between two instants, it does not capture a start time and end time.

Starting from Neo4j 5.9, some temporal types have been renamed. The table below shows the current as well as the old names of the temporal types.

 

Type

Old type name

## [](#cypher-temporal-timezones)Time zones

Time zones are represented either as an offset from UTC, or as a logical identifier of a _named time zone_ (these are based on the [IANA time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)). In either case, the time is stored as UTC internally, and the time zone offset is only applied when the time is presented. This means that temporal instants can be ordered without taking time zone into account. If, however, two times are identical in UTC, then they are ordered by timezone.

When creating a time using a named time zone, the offset from UTC is computed from the rules in the time zone database to create a time instant in UTC, and to ensure the named time zone is a valid one.

It is possible for time zone rules to change in the IANA time zone database. For example, there could be alterations to the rules for daylight savings time in a certain area. If this occurs after the creation of a temporal instant, the presented time could differ from the originally-entered time, insofar as the local timezone is concerned. However, the absolute time in UTC would remain the same.

There are three ways of specifying a time zone in Cypher:

*   Specifying the offset from UTC in hours and minutes ([ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
    
*   Specifying a named time zone.
    
*   Specifying both the offset and the time zone name (with the requirement that these match).
    

See [specifying time zones](#cypher-temporal-specify-time-zone) for examples.

The named time zone form uses the rules of the IANA time zone database to manage _daylight savings time_ (DST).

The default time zone of the database can be configured using the configuration option [`db.temporal.timezone`](/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings#config_db.temporal.timezone). This configuration option influences the creation of temporal types for the following functions:

*   Getting the current date and time without specifying a time zone.
    
*   Creating a temporal type from its components without specifying a time zone.
    
*   Creating a temporal type by parsing a `STRING` without specifying a time zone.
    
*   Creating a temporal type by combining or selecting values that do not have a time zone component, and without specifying a time zone.
    
*   Truncating a temporal value that does not have a time zone component, and without specifying a time zone.
    

## [](#cypher-temporal-instants)Temporal instants

### [](#cypher-temporal-specifying-temporal-instants)Specifying temporal instants

A temporal instant consists of three parts; the `date`, the `time`, and the `timezone`. These parts can be combined to produce the various temporal value types. The character `T` is a literal character.

 

Temporal instant type

Composition of parts

`DATE`

``

`LOCAL TIME`

`` or `T`

`ZONED TIME`

`` or `T`

`LOCAL DATETIME`\*

`T`

`ZONED DATETIME`\*

`T`

\*When `date` and `time` are combined, `date` must be complete; i.e. fully identify a particular day.

### [](#cypher-temporal-specify-date)Specifying dates

  

Component

Format

Description

Year

`YYYY`

Specified with at least four digits ([special rules apply in certain cases](#cypher-temporal-year)).

Month

`MM`

Specified with a double digit number from `01` to `12`.

Week

`ww`

Always prefixed with `W` and specified with a double digit number from `01` to `53`.

Quarter

`q`

Always prefixed with `Q` and specified with a single digit number from `1` to `4`.

Day of the month

`DD`

Specified with a double digit number from `01` to `31`.

Day of the week

`D`

Specified with a single digit number from `1` to `7`.

Day of the quarter

`DD`

Specified with a double digit number from `01` to `92`.

Ordinal day of the year

`DDD`

Specified with a triple digit number from `001` to `366`.

If the year is before `0000` or after `9999`, the following additional rules apply:

*   Minus sign, `-` must prefix any year before `0000`, (e.g. `-3000-01-01`).
    
*   Plus sign, `+` must prefix any year after `9999`, (e.g. `+11000-01-01`).
    
*   The year must be separated with `-` from the next component:
    
    *   if the next component is month, (e.g. `+11000-01`).
        
    *   if the next component is day of the year, (e.g. `+11000-123`).
        
    

If the year component is prefixed with either `-` or `+`, and is separated from the next component, `Year` is allowed to contain up to nine digits. Thus, the allowed range of years is between -999,999,999 and +999,999,999. For all other cases, i.e. the year is between `0000` and `9999` (inclusive), `Year` must have exactly four digits (the year component is interpreted as a year of the Common Era (CE)).

The following formats are supported for specifying dates:

The smallest components can be omitted. Cypher will assume omitted components to have their lowest possible value. For example, `2013-06` will be interpreted as being the same date as `2013-06-01`.

### [](#cypher-temporal-specify-time)Specifying times

  

Component

Format

Description

`Hour`

`HH`

Specified with a double digit number from `00` to `23`.

`Minute`

`MM`

Specified with a double digit number from `00` to `59`.

`Second`

`SS`

Specified with a double digit number from `00` to `59`.

`fraction`

`sssssssss`

Specified with a number from `0` to `999999999`. It is not required to specify leading zeros. `fraction` is an optional, sub-second component of `Second`. This can be separated from `Second` using either a full stop (`.`) or a comma (`,`). The `fraction` is in addition to the two digits of `Second`.

Cypher does not support leap seconds; [UTC-SLS](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/) (_UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds_) is used to manage the difference in time between UTC and TAI (_International Atomic Time_).

The following formats are supported for specifying times:

   

Format

Description

Example

Interpretation of example

`HH:MM:SS.sssssssss`

`Hour:Minute:Second.fraction`

`21:40:32.142`

`21:40:32.142`

`HHMMSS.sssssssss`

`Hour:Minute:Second.fraction`

`214032.142`

`21:40:32.142`

`HH:MM:SS`

`Hour:Minute:Second`

`Hour:Minute`

`2140`

`21:40:00.000`

`HH`

`Hour`

`21`

`21:00:00.000`

The smallest components can be omitted. For example, a time may be specified with `Hour` and `Minute`, leaving out `Second` and `fraction`. On the other hand, specifying a time with `Hour` and `Second`, while leaving out `Minute`, is not possible.

#### [](#cypher-temporal-specify-time-zone)Specifying time zones

The time zone is specified in one of the following ways:

*   As an offset from UTC.
    
*   Using the `Z` shorthand for the UTC (`Â±00:00`) time zone.
    

When specifying a time zone as an offset from UTC, the rules below apply:

*   The time zone always starts with either a plus (`+`) or minus (`-`) sign.
    
    *   Positive offsets, i.e. time zones beginning with `+`, denote time zones east of UTC.
        
    *   Negative offsets, i.e. time zones beginning with `-`, denote time zones west of UTC.
        
    
*   A double-digit hour offset follows the `+`/`-` sign.
    
*   An optional double-digit minute offset follows the hour offset, optionally separated by a colon (`:`).
    
*   The time zone of the International Date Line is denoted either by `+12:00` or `-12:00`, depending on country.
    

When creating values of the `ZONED DATETIME` temporal instant type, the time zone may also be specified using a named time zone, using the names from the IANA time zone database. This may be provided either in addition to, or in place of the offset. The named time zone is given last and is enclosed in square brackets (`[]`). Should both the offset and the named time zone be provided, the offset must match the named time zone.

The following formats are supported for specifying time zones:

## [](#cypher-temporal-durations)Durations

### [](#cypher-temporal-specifying-durations)Specifying durations

A `DURATION` represents a temporal amount, capturing the difference in time between two instants, and can be negative.

The specification of a `DURATION` is prefixed with a `P`, and can use either a _unit-based form_ or a _date-and-time-based form_:

*   Unit-based form: `P[nY][nM][nW][nD][T[nH][nM][nS]]`
    
    *   The square brackets (`[]`) denote an optional component (components with a zero value may be omitted).
        
    *   The `n` denotes a numeric value within the bounds of a 64-bit integer.
        
    *   The value of the lastâââand smallestâââcomponent may contain a decimal fraction.
        
    *   Each component must be suffixed by a component identifier denoting the unit.
        
    *   The unit-based form uses `M` as a suffix for both months and minutes. Therefore, time parts must always be preceded with `T`, even when no components of the date part are given.
        
    *   The maximum total length of a duration is bounded by the number of seconds that can be held in a 64-bit integer.
        
    
*   Date-and-time-based form: `PT`.
    
    *   Unlike the unit-based form, this form requires each component to be within the bounds of a valid `LOCAL DATETIME`.
        
    

The following table lists the component identifiers for the unit-based form:

Must be specified before `T`.

`W`

### [](#cypher-temporal-accessing-components-durations)Components of durations

A `DURATION` can have several components, each categorized into _Months_, _Days_, and _Seconds_ groups.

Components of `DURATION` values are truncated within their component groups as follows:

### [](#cypher-temporal-examples)Examples

Below are examples of parsing durations using the `duration()` function. More information can be found [here](../../functions/temporal/duration/).

Example 11. Return a duration of `14` _days_, `16` _hours_, and `12` _minutes_

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration('P14DT16H12M') AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P14DT16H12M`

Rows: 1

Example 12. Return a duration of `5` _months_, `1` _day_, and `12` _hours_

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration('P5M1.5D') AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P5M1DT12H`

Rows: 1

Example 13. Return a duration of `45` seconds

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration('PT0.75M') AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`PT45S`

Rows: 1

Example 14. Return a duration of `2` _weeks_, `3` _days_, and `12` _hours_

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration('P2.5W') AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P17DT12H`

Rows: 1

Example 15. Get the month-based components of a `DURATION` value

Query

```cypher hljs
WITH duration({years: 1, months: 5, days: 111, minutes: 42}) AS d
RETURN d.years, d.quarters, d.quartersOfYear, d.months, d.monthsOfYear, d.monthsOfQuarter
```

Result      

d.years

d.quarters

d.quartersOfYear

d.months

d.monthsOfYear

d.monthsOfQuarter

`1`

`5`

`1`

`17`

`5`

`2`

Rows: 1

`d.quarters` has a value of `5` because the year of the duration has four quarters and there is another quarter in the five months. `d.months` has a value of `17` because it adds the 12 months in the year of the duration to the five months. `d.quartersOfYear` is the remaining quarter, counting towards the next full year. Similarly, `d.monthsOfYear` and `d.monthsOfQuarter` count towards the next full year and quarter respectively. See tables _First order `DURATION` components_ and _Second order `DURATION` components_ in [Components of durations](#cypher-temporal-accessing-components-durations).

Example 16. Get the days-based components of a `DURATION` value

Query

```cypher hljs
WITH duration({months: 5, days: 25, hours: 1}) AS d
RETURN d.weeks, d.days, d.daysOfWeek
```

Result   

d.weeks

d.days

d.daysOfWeek

`3`

`25`

`4`

Rows: 1

`d.weeks` has a value of 3 because the 25 days from the query are three full weeks (or 21 days). `d.daysOfWeek` are the remaining days, counting towards the next full week. See tables _First order `DURATION` components_ and _Second order `DURATION` components_ in [Components of durations](#cypher-temporal-accessing-components-durations).

Example 17. Get the first order seconds-based components of a `DURATION` value

Query

```cypher hljs
WITH duration({
  years: 1, months:1, days:1, hours: 1,
  minutes: 1, seconds: 1, nanoseconds: 111111111
}) AS d
RETURN d.hours, d.minutes, d.seconds, d.milliseconds, d.microseconds, d.nanoseconds
```

Result      

d.hours

d.minutes

d.seconds

d.milliseconds

d.microseconds

d.nanoseconds

`1`

`61`

`3661`

`3661111`

`3661111111`

`3661111111111`

Rows: 1

`d.minutes` is the sum of 60 minutes of the hour and the one minute from the query as both `duration.hours` and `duration.minutes` are both seconds-based components. Similarly, `d.seconds`, `d.milliseconds`, `d.microseconds` and `d.nanoseconds` are sum values of the relevant seconds-based components from the query.

`d.hours` does not take the day from the query into account because `duration.days` is a days-based component.

See table _First order `DURATION` components_ in [Components of durations](#cypher-temporal-accessing-components-durations).

Example 18. Get the second order seconds-based components of a `DURATION` value

Query

```cypher hljs
WITH duration({
  years: 1, months:1, days:1,
  hours: 1, minutes: 1, seconds: 1, nanoseconds: 111111111
}) AS d
RETURN d.minutesOfHour, d.secondsOfMinute, d.millisecondsOfSecond, d.microsecondsOfSecond, d.nanosecondsOfSecond
```

Result     

d.minutesOfHour

d.secondsOfMinute

d.millisecondsOfSecond

d.microsecondsOfSecond

d.nanosecondsOfSecond

`1`

`1`

`111`

`111111`

`111111111`

Rows: 1

The returned values all count towards the next full hour, minute or second respectively. For example, `d.microsecondsOfSecond` has a value of `111111` because it is the `111111111` nanoseconds from the query in microseconds (rounded down) but it is not another full second.

See table _Second order `DURATION` components_ in [Components of durations](#cypher-temporal-accessing-components-durations).

Example 19. Create a duration representing 1.5 _days_

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration({days: 1, hours: 12}) AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P1DT12H`

Rows: 1

Example 20. Compute the `DURATION` between two temporal instants

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration.between(date('1984-10-11'), date('2015-06-24')) AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P30Y8M13D`

Rows: 1

Example 21. Compute the number of days between two `DATE` values

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration.inDays(date('2014-10-11'), date('2015-08-06')) AS theDuration

theDuration

`P299D`

Rows: 1

Example 22. Get the `DATE` of the last day of the next month

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN date.truncate('month', date() + duration('P2M')) - duration('P1D') AS lastDay

`2022-07-31`

Rows: 1

Example 23. Add a `DURATION` to a `DATE`

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN time('13:42:19') + duration({days: 1, hours: 12}) AS theTime
```

Result 

theTime

`01:42:19.000000000+00:00`

Rows: 1

Example 24. Add two `DURATION` values

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration({days: 2, hours: 7}) + duration({months: 1, hours: 18}) AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

`P1M2DT25H`

Rows: 1

Example 25. Multiply a `DURATION` by a number

Query

```cypher hljs
RETURN duration({hours: 5, minutes: 21}) * 14 AS theDuration
```

Result 

theDuration

## [](#cypher-temporal-index)Temporal indexing

All temporal types can be indexed, and thereby support exact lookups for equality predicates. Indexes for temporal instant types additionally support range lookups.

* * *

[1](#_footnoteref_1). This is in accordance with the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar); i.e. years AD/CE start at year 1, and the year before that (year 1 BC/BCE) is 0, while year 2 BCE is -1 etc.

[2](#_footnoteref_2). The [first week of any year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#First_week) is the week that contains the first Thursday of the year, and thus always contains January 4.

[3](#_footnoteref_3). For dates from December 29, this could be the next year, and for dates until January 3 this could be the previous year, depending on how week 1 begins.

[4](#_footnoteref_4). Cypher does not support leap seconds; UTC-SLS (UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds) is used to manage the difference in time between UTC and TAI (International Atomic Time).

[5](#_footnoteref_5). The expression datetime().epochMillis returns the equivalent value of the timestamp() function.

[6](#_footnoteref_6). For the nanosecond part of the epoch offset, the regular nanosecond component (instant.nanosecond) can be used.
