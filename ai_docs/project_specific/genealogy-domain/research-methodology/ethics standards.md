Standards are the best practices for genealogy. They enable all genealogists—not just BCG associates—to come as close as possible to what actually happened in history.  

### Standards for Documenting

Documentation standards direct genealogists to cite sources for every fact not common knowledge. Complete documentation shows the quality of sources and scope of research underlying any given work.[\[1\]](#fn1)

### Standards for Researching

Research standards help genealogists plan research, collect data, and reason soundly from evidence.

* * *

### Planning Research

Research begins with a focused question and seeks to answer it by consulting relevant sources in a logical order, while maintaining flexibility in case of surprises.[\[1\]](#fn1)

### Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)

To reach a sound conclusion, we need to meet all five components of the GPS.

1\. Reasonably exhaustive research.

2\. Complete and accurate source citations.

3\. Thorough analysis and correlation.

4\. Resolution of conflicting evidence.

5\. Soundly written conclusion based on the strongest evidence.[\[3\]](#fn3)

The GPS overarches all of the documentation, research, and writing standards described in _[Genealogy Standards](/component/hikashop/product/109-genealogy-standards-2d-edition)_, and is applied across the board in all genealogical research to measure the credibility of conclusions about ancestral identities, relationships, and life events.[\[4\]](#fn4)

### Genealogist's Code of Ethics

Each individual seeking certification signs The Genealogist’s Code of Ethics, a pledge to protect the public, clients (whether paying or pro bono), the profession, and people who provide DNA samples. This code was updated by BCG on 11 March 2025 and is effective immediately.

* * *

## To protect the public

*   I will not publish or publicize as a fact anything I know to be false, doubtful or unproved; nor will I be a party, directly or indirectly, to such action by others.
*   I will identify my sources for all information and cite only those I have personally used.
*   I will quote sources precisely, avoiding any alterations that I do not clearly identify as editorial interpretations.
*   I will present the purpose, practice, scope, and possibilities of genealogical research within a realistic framework.
*   I will delineate my abilities, publications, and/or fees in a true and realistic fashion.
*   I will not publish any personal, genealogical, or genetic information disclosed to me unless I have informed consent or omit personally identifying detail. I will also treat publicly available information about living people with sensitivity and will not publish any information with foreseeable potential for harm.

* * *

## To protect the client (paying or pro bono)

*   I will provide competent professional services to my clients. Competent services require the genealogical knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the rendering of the client-requested services.
*   I will act with reasonable diligence and promptness in handling client work.
*   I will keep my clients reasonably informed about the status of the client-requested services.
*   I will reveal to the client any personal or financial interests that might compromise my professional obligations.
*   I will undertake paid research commissions only after a clear agreement as to scope and fee.
*   I will, to the best of my abilities, address my research to the issue raised by the client and report to that question.
*   I will seek from the client all prior information and documentation related to the research and will not knowingly repeat the work as billable hours without explanation as to good cause.
*   I will furnish only facts I can substantiate with adequate documentation; and I will not withhold any data necessary for the client’s purpose.
*   If the research question involves analysis of data in order to establish a genealogical relationship or identity, I will report that the conclusions are based on the weight of the available evidence and that absolute proof of genealogical relationships is usually not possible.
*   If I cannot resolve a research problem within the limitations of time or budget established by contract, I will explain the reasons why.
*   If other feasible avenues are available, I will suggest them; but I will not misrepresent the possibilities of additional research.
*   I will return any advance payment that exceeds the hours and expenses incurred.
*   I will not publish or circulate reports in which a client or colleague has a proprietary interest without that person’s informed consent. I will respect this interest whether my report was made directly to the client or to an employer or agent.

* * *

## To protect the profession

*   I will act, speak, and write in a manner I believe to be in the best interests of the profession and scholarship of genealogy.
*   I will participate in exposing genealogical fraud; but I will not otherwise knowingly injure or attempt to injure the reputation, prospects, or practice of another genealogist.
*   I will not attempt to supplant another genealogist already employed by a client or agency. I will substitute for another researcher only with specific, written consent of and instructions provided by the client or agency.
*   I will not represent as my own the work of another. This includes works that are copyrighted, in the public domain, or unpublished. This pledge includes reports, lecture materials, audio/visual tapes, compiled records, and authored essays.
*   I will not reproduce for public dissemination, in an oral or written fashion, the work of another genealogist, writer, or lecturer without that person’s written consent. In citing another’s work, I will give proper credit.

* * *

## To protect people who provide DNA samples

*   When seeking DNA from a living person for genealogical research, I will explain

a) how I would use and share their genetic information and the risks and benefits of that use and sharing;

b) the possibility and consequences of discovering unanticipated relatives, unknown medical conditions, unexpected ethnic backgrounds, and intentional misinformation about such situations;

c) options for openness and privacy, how other researchers could or could not access the data; and why complete anonymity and privacy can never be guaranteed.

After providing this information, I will request and comply with the consent, freely given by the person providing the DNA sample or that person’s guardian or legal representative.

*   When working with DNA test results of living people, I will not publish personally identifying information without each test taker’s consent. I will not privately share a match list without the list owner’s consent. If I have the list owner’s consent, I may privately share details of a match without the match’s consent.

* * *

### Discipline and Dispute Resolution

BCG’s bylaws provide for a system of discipline and dispute resolution in order to enhance public confidence in the work of Board-certified genealogists.

* * *

BCG's bylaws provide that each certified associate be subject to discipline for conduct in violation of the Genealogist's Code. \[[Bylaws](/images/files/BCG_Bylaws.pdf): Article 9, Sections 1-5.\]

BCG will provide its dispute resolution service as an expeditious and low-cost alternative to litigation, to resolve disputes between its certified associates and any members of the public who agree to accept its determination as a final and binding resolution of the matters in dispute, and consent to enforcement of the board's determination by appropriate legal process in any tribunal having jurisdiction over the person or property of the parties. (The consent form is available as a [PDF file here.](/images/files/BCG-Dispute-Resolution-Consent.pdf))

The dispute resolution process is set out in the Discipline and Dispute Resolution policies (available as a [PDF file here](/images/files/BCG-Dispute-Policy.pdf)) and consists, first, of mediation and, second, of binding arbitration.

When a dispute complaint against a certified associate is resolved during mediation or arbitration, copies of the following documents will be placed in the certified associate’s permanent file:

– the original letter of complaint;  
– the final letter from BCG to the complainant and the certified associate confirming that a settlement was reached during mediation or arbitration.

* * *

## Appeal

The certified person shall have the right to appeal the determination of the Executive Committee as to individual discipline to the full board in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the executive committee’s determination.

The BCG trustees, when deciding appeals from executive committee decisions on complaints or disciplinary actions, shall consider only evidence and complaint-related records previously available to the executive committee, unless clearly relevant evidence was withheld from the executive committee by an interested party. The decision of the board shall be by two-thirds affirmative vote and shall be final and binding, and shall be made available to the certified person in writing with reasonable promptness and included in the certified person’s permanent file.
