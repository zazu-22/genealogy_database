# Implement Feature

Please implement the following feature: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Review the feature requirements against our project architecture and data model
2. Plan the implementation with attention to:
   - How it fits into the existing system architecture
   - Required changes to data models
   - How it handles uncertain or conflicting information
   - Source attribution requirements
   - Research methodology alignment
   - Privacy and ethical considerations

3. Design a test plan following TDD principles that verifies:
   - Core functionality works as expected
   - Edge cases are handled properly
   - Error conditions are managed gracefully
   - Integration with existing components

4. Implement the required unit tests first

5. Implement the feature with careful attention to:
   - Type safety
   - Field-level change tracking
   - Proper source attribution
   - Alignment with genealogical standards

6. Document the implementation:
   - Update relevant architecture documents
   - Add inline code documentation
   - Consider user documentation needs

7. Verify all tests pass and the feature meets requirements

8. Prepare a summary of the implementation explaining key design decisions
