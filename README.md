# Genealogy Database System

A comprehensive genealogy database system designed to address limitations in existing solutions. This project focuses on evidence-based research management, advanced relationship modeling, and quality control while maintaining compatibility with genealogical standards and open formats.

## Project Vision

This system aims to provide professional-grade genealogical research tooling with:

- Robust data modeling for complex genealogical information
- Evidence-based research management aligned with professional standards
- Advanced relationship modeling including non-traditional and temporal relationships
- Historical context preservation for places, dates, and events
- Comprehensive version control and data quality mechanisms

## Key Features

- **Person Entity Model**: Support for uncertain data, multiple name forms, comprehensive events, and conflicting information
- **Relationship Modeling**: Complex family structures, non-familial relationships, temporal dimensions
- **Place Management**: Historical context, jurisdictional changes, geocoding integration
- **Temporal Framework**: Date approximations, calendar conversions, timeline visualization
- **Research Management**: Citation templates, source classification, research organization
- **Analysis Framework**: Genealogical Proof Standard support, conflict resolution tools
- **Data Quality**: Authority control, duplicate detection, validation
- **Version Control**: Field-level change tracking, multiple research theories
- **Integration**: GEDCOM 7, API endpoints, repository integration
- **Publishing**: Report templates, chart generation, privacy controls
