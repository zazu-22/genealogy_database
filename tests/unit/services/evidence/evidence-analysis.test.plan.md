# Evidence Analysis Services Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for the Evidence Analysis Services, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The tests will verify functionality, handle edge cases, manage error conditions, and ensure proper integration with existing components.

## 1. Test Scope

The test suite will cover the following service components:

1. **Source Classification Service**
   - Classification of sources based on attributes
   - Determination of originality
   - Evaluation of informant knowledge
   - Assessment of contemporaneity
   - Assessment of clarity

2. **Information Evaluation Service**
   - Evaluation of information quality
   - Calculation of source reliability
   - Detection and resolution of information conflicts

3. **Evidence Categorization Service**
   - Categorization of evidence types
   - Identification of direct, indirect, and negative evidence
   - Calculation of evidence weight

4. **GPS Evaluation Service**
   - Evaluation of reasonably exhaustive research
   - Assessment of citation completeness
   - Evaluation of analysis quality
   - Assessment of conflict resolution
   - Evaluation of conclusion soundness
   - Calculation of overall GPS compliance

5. **Main Evidence Analysis Service**
   - Source analysis
   - Assertion confidence calculation
   - Evidence correlation

## 2. Test Approach

### Unit Tests

Each service component will have dedicated unit tests to verify its functionality in isolation. Dependencies will be mocked to ensure true unit testing.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify the interaction between different service components and with the database layer.

### Mock Strategy

- MongoDB models will be mocked to isolate the services from the database
- Research questions and sources will be created as mock data
- Mock repositories will be used to simulate database operations

## 3. Test Cases

### 3.1 Source Classification Service Tests

#### 3.1.1 Source Classification

- Should classify a source based on its attributes
- Should determine correct originality based on source type
- Should evaluate informant knowledge correctly
- Should assess contemporaneity based on time proximity
- Should assess clarity based on source legibility

#### 3.1.2 Edge Cases

- Should handle classification of incomplete sources
- Should handle unknown source types
- Should determine originality for edge case sources

### 3.2 Information Evaluation Service Tests

#### 3.2.1 Information Quality

- Should evaluate information quality based on classification
- Should calculate source reliability scores
- Should detect conflicts between sources
- Should resolve information conflicts with explanation

#### 3.2.2 Edge Cases

- Should handle evaluation with minimal information
- Should handle sources with no classification
- Should detect conflicts when partial information matches

### 3.3 Evidence Categorization Service Tests

#### 3.3.1 Evidence Categorization

- Should categorize evidence as direct, indirect, or negative
- Should correctly identify direct evidence
- Should correctly identify indirect evidence
- Should correctly identify negative evidence
- Should calculate evidence weight based on quality and relevance

#### 3.3.2 Edge Cases

- Should handle categorization with limited information
- Should identify contradictory evidence
- Should calculate weight for edge case evidence

### 3.4 GPS Evaluation Service Tests

#### 3.4.1 GPS Compliance

- Should evaluate reasonably exhaustive research
- Should assess citation completeness
- Should evaluate analysis quality
- Should assess conflict resolution
- Should evaluate conclusion soundness
- Should calculate overall GPS compliance

#### 3.4.2 Edge Cases

- Should handle evaluation with minimal research
- Should handle evaluation with no citations
- Should provide helpful recommendations for improvement

### 3.5 Evidence Analysis Service Tests

#### 3.5.1 Main Functionality

- Should analyze a source completely
- Should calculate assertion confidence from multiple sources
- Should correlate evidence from multiple sources

#### 3.5.2 Edge Cases

- Should handle analysis of sources with conflicting information
- Should provide recommendations for improving source quality
- Should handle correlation with no matching evidence

### 3.6 Error Handling Tests

- Should handle database connection errors gracefully
- Should handle invalid source IDs
- Should handle invalid citation IDs
- Should handle invalid research question IDs
- Should validate input parameters

## 4. Test Structure

Each test file will follow this structure:

1. Import dependencies and services
2. Set up mock data and repositories
3. Initialize service under test with mocks
4. Define test cases in describe/it blocks
5. Clean up after tests

## 5. Mock Data Requirements

The following mock data will be created:

1. **Sources**
   - Various types (vital records, census, newspapers, etc.)
   - Different qualities and reliabilities
   - Some with conflicts, some without

2. **Citations**
   - Complete, partial, and minimal citations
   - Citations linking to various sources

3. **Research Questions**
   - Questions with various complexity
   - Questions with clear and ambiguous answers
   - Questions with conflicting evidence

## 6. Testing Tools

- Jest as the test runner
- ts-jest for TypeScript support
- jest-mock for mocking
- mongodb-memory-server for database testing

## 7. Test File Organization

```

    services/
      evidence/
        source-classification.service.test.ts
        information-evaluation.service.test.ts

```

## 8. Implementation Order

Tests will be implemented in the following order:

1. Source Classification Service tests
2. Information Evaluation Service tests
3. Evidence Categorization Service tests
4. GPS Evaluation Service tests
5. Main Evidence Analysis Service tests
6. Integration tests

## 9. Test Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass
- Code coverage is at least 80% for all service files
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Error conditions are gracefully managed
- Tests run in a reasonable time (under 10 seconds for unit tests)
