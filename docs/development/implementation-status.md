# Implementation Status and Next Steps

This document tracks the current implementation status of the Genealogy Database System and outlines the next priorities for development.

## Current Status

The project is transitioning from the Foundation Layer to the Evidence Framework phase of implementation. We have completed:

- Core data models based on GEDCOM X with evidence-based extensions
- Database configurations for Neo4j (relationship graph) and MongoDB (source documents)
- Type definitions for all major entities (Person, Relationship, Source, etc.)
- Initial schema for Source and Citation entities
- Evidence Analysis Services with source classification, information evaluation, and evidence categorization

## Implementation Progress

### Recently Completed

#### Evidence Analysis Services

Implemented comprehensive Evidence Analysis Services that include:

- Source Classification Service for evaluating sources based on originality, informant knowledge, contemporaneity, and clarity
- Information Evaluation Service for assessing information quality and reliability
- Evidence Categorization Service for identifying direct, indirect, and negative evidence
- GPS Evaluation Service for Genealogical Proof Standard compliance assessment
- Main Evidence Analysis Service combining all functionality with conflict detection and resolution

These services follow Elizabeth Shown Mills' evidence evaluation framework and support the Genealogical Proof Standard methodology. The implementation includes full test coverage with unit tests for each component.

## Next Implementation Priorities

The following items represent the next development priorities for the Evidence Framework phase:

1. **High Priority**
   - Develop Research Management Services for GPS compliance tracking and research log management
   - Create Source Citation Services with Mills templates support
   - Integrate conflict resolution system with existing Evidence Analysis Services

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Build relationship service with temporal data handling and evidence attribution
   - Implement Person service with uncertain data and conflicting information support
   - Develop Place service with historical context and jurisdictional changes support
   - Create GraphQL schema for evidence-based queries

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these services, remember to follow these core principles:

1. All assertions must include source attribution
2. Support for uncertain or conflicting information is essential
3. Implement temporal context for all entities and relationships
4. Follow Genealogical Proof Standard methodology
5. Ensure proper handling of evidence quality assessment

## Progress Tracking

Development progress will be tracked in this document and in the project CHANGELOG. When completing a task, update both documents with a brief description of the implementation.

## Next Phase Preview

After completing the Evidence Framework phase, the project will move to the Advanced Features phase, which will include:

1. Research workflow implementation
2. Tools for handling uncertain information
3. Evidence correlation algorithms
4. Advanced search and retrieval
