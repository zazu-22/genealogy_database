# Implementation Status and Next Steps

This document tracks the current implementation status of the Genealogy Database System and outlines the next priorities for development.

## Current Status

The project is transitioning from the Foundation Layer to the Evidence Framework phase of implementation. We have completed:

- Core data models based on GEDCOM X with evidence-based extensions
- Database configurations for Neo4j (relationship graph) and MongoDB (source documents)
- Type definitions for all major entities (Person, Relationship, Source, etc.)
- Initial schema for Source and Citation entities
- Evidence Analysis Services with source classification, information evaluation, and evidence categorization

## Implementation Progress

### Recently Completed

#### Evidence Analysis Services

Implemented comprehensive Evidence Analysis Services that include:

- Source Classification Service for evaluating sources based on originality, informant knowledge, contemporaneity, and clarity
- Information Evaluation Service for assessing information quality and reliability
- Evidence Categorization Service for identifying direct, indirect, and negative evidence
- GPS Evaluation Service for Genealogical Proof Standard compliance assessment
- Main Evidence Analysis Service combining all functionality with conflict detection and resolution

These services follow Elizabeth Shown Mills' evidence evaluation framework and support the Genealogical Proof Standard methodology. The implementation includes full test coverage with unit tests for each component.

## Next Implementation Priorities

Based on a thorough review of genealogical methodology standards, we have revised our implementation priorities to better align with professional genealogical practice. The following items represent the updated development priorities for the Evidence Framework phase:

### Highest Priority

- **Research Question Management Service** - Develop a dedicated service for formulating, validating, and tracking progress on specific research questions following BCG guidelines
- **Source Citation Services** - Create comprehensive citation management with Mills templates support, ensuring all evidence is properly attributed
- **Research Log Management** - Implement functionality to track sources searched (including negative searches), search strategies, and findings
- **Enhanced Conflict Resolution System** - Expand the conflict resolution framework with structured documentation for conflicting evidence, explicit reasoning for resolution choices, and evidence weighting

### High Priority

- **Research Planning Component** - Add functionality to create research plans based on specific questions, identify potential sources, and establish search strategies
- **Person Service** - Implement support for uncertain data, conflicting information, and alternative identities
- **Relationship Service** - Build with FAN principle support (Friends, Associates, Neighbors) and temporal data handling for comprehensive network analysis

### Medium Priority

- **Place Service** - Develop with historical context and jurisdictional changes support
- **GraphQL Schema** - Create schema for evidence-based queries
- **Proof Argument Generation** - Implement tools to assist in creating soundly reasoned conclusions based on the evidence

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these services, remember to follow these core principles:

1. All assertions must include source attribution
2. Support for uncertain or conflicting information is essential
3. Implement temporal context for all entities and relationships
4. Follow Genealogical Proof Standard methodology
5. Ensure proper handling of evidence quality assessment
6. Utilize the FAN principle for context-based research
7. Maintain clear research questions to guide the process

## Progress Tracking

Development progress will be tracked in this document and in the project CHANGELOG. When completing a task, update both documents with a brief description of the implementation.

## Next Phase Preview

After completing the Evidence Framework phase, the project will move to the Advanced Features phase, which will include:

1. Research workflow implementation
2. Advanced evidence correlation algorithms
3. Collaborative research capabilities
4. Automated research suggestions
5. Advanced search and retrieval
