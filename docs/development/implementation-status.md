# Implementation Status and Next Steps

This document tracks the current implementation status of the Genealogy Database System and outlines the next priorities for development.

## Current Status

The project is transitioning from the Foundation Layer to the Evidence Framework phase of implementation. We have completed:

- Core data models based on GEDCOM X with evidence-based extensions
- Database configurations for Neo4j (relationship graph) and MongoDB (source documents)
- Type definitions for all major entities (Person, Relationship, Source, etc.)
- Initial schema for Source and Citation entities

## Next Implementation Priorities

The following items represent the next development priorities for the Evidence Framework phase:

1. **High Priority**
   - Implement Evidence Analysis Services with source classification, information evaluation, and evidence categorization
   - Develop Research Management Services for GPS compliance tracking and research log management
   - Create Source Citation Services with Mills templates support
   - Implement conflict resolution system for contradictory evidence

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Build relationship service with temporal data handling and evidence attribution
   - Implement Person service with uncertain data and conflicting information support
   - Develop Place service with historical context and jurisdictional changes support
   - Create GraphQL schema for evidence-based queries

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these services, remember to follow these core principles:

1. All assertions must include source attribution
2. Support for uncertain or conflicting information is essential
3. Implement temporal context for all entities and relationships
4. Follow Genealogical Proof Standard methodology
5. Ensure proper handling of evidence quality assessment

## Progress Tracking

Development progress will be tracked in this document and in the project CHANGELOG. When completing a task, update both documents with a brief description of the implementation.

## Next Phase Preview

After completing the Evidence Framework phase, the project will move to the Advanced Features phase, which will include:

1. Research workflow implementation
2. Tools for handling uncertain information
3. Evidence correlation algorithms
4. Advanced search and retrieval
