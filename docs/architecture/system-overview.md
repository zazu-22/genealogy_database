# Genealogy Database System Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the Genealogy Database System, explaining the core components, their interactions, and the underlying design principles.

## System Architecture

The Genealogy Database System uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Layer

The foundation of the system consists of two primary data stores:

- **Graph Database**: Handles the complex relationship networks inherent in genealogical data
  - Stores person entities, relationships, places, and their interconnections
  - Enables complex traversal queries across family networks
  - Supports temporal dimensions for all entities and relationships
  - Recommended implementation: Neo4j

- **Document Store**: Manages unstructured source materials and research documents
  - Stores source documents, images, and other research materials
  - Supports full-text search and content extraction
  - Manages citation templates and source metadata
  - Recommended implementation: MongoDB or similar document database

#### 2. Service Layer

The service layer encapsulates the core business logic:

- **Entity Services**: Manage core entities (Person, Relationship, Place, etc.)
  - Handle CRUD operations with validation and business rules
  - Implement field-level change tracking
  - Enforce data quality mechanisms

- **Research Services**: Support genealogical research workflows
  - Manage source citations and evidence analysis
  - Implement research task tracking
  - Support hypothesis testing and conflict resolution

- **Analysis Services**: Provide analytical capabilities
  - Implement Genealogical Proof Standard workflow
  - Detect inconsistencies and research gaps
  - Generate relationship insights and suggestions

#### 3. API Layer

The API layer provides standardized access to system functionality:

- **GraphQL API**: Primary interface for client applications
  - Provides flexible querying capabilities
  - Supports complex relationship navigation
  - Enables efficient data retrieval for UI components

- **REST Endpoints**: Support for specific operations and integrations
  - GEDCOM import/export
  - Batch operations
  - External system integrations

#### 4. Presentation Layer

Multiple interfaces provide access to system functionality:

- **Web Interface**: Primary user interface
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Progressive enhancement approach
  - Component-based architecture

- **Command Line Interface**: For power users and automation
  - Batch operations
  - Scripting capabilities
  - System administration

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Authentication and Authorization

- Supports single-user and optional multi-user modes
- Fine-grained access control for collaborative scenarios
- Privacy filtering for sensitive information

### Version Control

- Field-level change tracking
- Support for multiple research theories as branches
- Snapshot creation for stable reference points

### Data Quality

- Authority control for names, places, and sources
- Duplicate detection with configurable matching rules
- Data validation based on genealogical standards
- Consistency checking across related records

### Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for additional features
- Scripting support for custom workflows
- Webhook integration for external system notifications

## Deployment Models

The system supports multiple deployment configurations:

1. **Local-First**: Primary deployment model
   - All data stored locally
   - Full functionality without internet connection
   - Optional cloud synchronization

2. **Self-Hosted Server**: For collaborative scenarios
   - Centralized data storage
   - Multi-user access with permissions
   - Web interface served from central location

3. **Hybrid Model**: Combines local and server components
   - Local data storage with server synchronization
   - Shared research repositories
   - Collaborative features with offline capability

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Neo4j (graph) and MongoDB (document)
- **API**: GraphQL with Apollo Server and RESTful endpoints
- **Web Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **CLI**: Node.js command-line application
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with UI components or CLI
2. Requests routed through GraphQL or REST API
3. API layer validates requests and calls appropriate services
4. Service layer applies business logic and data transformations
5. Data layer performs persistence operations
6. Changes tracked in version control system
7. Results returned to user with appropriate formatting

## Security Considerations

- All data encrypted at rest
- Transport security for networked deployments
- Privacy controls for living individuals
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Regular backup procedures

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient graph traversal for complex relationship queries
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Pagination and lazy loading for large result sets
- Batch processing for resource-intensive operations
- Optimistic UI updates with background synchronization
