# Genealogy Database System Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture for the Genealogy Database System, explaining the core components, their interactions, and the underlying design principles.

## System Architecture

The Genealogy Database System uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Layer

The foundation of the system consists of two primary data stores with GEDCOM X as the conceptual data model:

- **Graph Database (Neo4j)**: Handles the complex relationship networks inherent in genealogical data
  - Stores person entities, relationships, places, and their interconnections
  - Enables complex traversal queries across family networks
  - Supports temporal dimensions for all entities and relationships
  - Implements evidence attribution on all assertions
  - Supports confidence metrics on relationships

- **Document Store (MongoDB)**: Manages unstructured source materials and research documents
  - Stores source documents, images, and other research materials
  - Supports full-text search and content extraction
  - Manages citation templates based on Elizabeth Shown Mills standards
  - Implements source classification and evidence evaluation
  - Stores research logs and GPS compliance metrics

#### 2. Service Layer

The service layer encapsulates the core business logic with emphasis on evidence evaluation:

- **Entity Services**: Manage core entities (Person, Relationship, Place, etc.)
  - Handle CRUD operations with validation and business rules
  - Implement field-level change tracking with evidence attribution
  - Enforce data quality through source validation

- **Evidence Analysis Services**: Core of the genealogical research system
  - Classify sources (original/derivative/authored)
  - Evaluate information (primary/secondary/indeterminable)
  - Categorize evidence (direct/indirect/negative)
  - Support conflict resolution for contradictory evidence

- **Research Management Services**: Support genealogical research methodology
  - Track "reasonably exhaustive" research compliance
  - Manage source citations with Mills templates
  - Implement research log and task tracking
  - Support hypothesis testing with evidence correlation

- **Analysis Services**: Provide advanced analytical capabilities
  - Implement Genealogical Proof Standard workflow
  - Detect inconsistencies and research gaps
  - Generate relationship insights based on evidence quality
  - Manage uncertain or conflicting information

#### 3. API Layer

The API layer provides standardized access to system functionality:

- **GraphQL API with Apollo Server**: Primary interface for client applications
  - Provides flexible querying with evidence attribution
  - Supports complex relationship navigation with confidence metrics
  - Enables efficient data retrieval for UI components
  - Facilitates evidence analysis workflows

- **REST Endpoints**: Support for specific operations and integrations
  - GEDCOM X import/export capabilities
  - GEDCOM (legacy) import support
  - Batch operations for high-volume processing
  - External system integrations (FamilySearch, etc.)

#### 4. Presentation Layer

Multiple interfaces provide access to system functionality with emphasis on research workflows:

- **Web Interface**: Primary user interface
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Research workflow components based on GPS
  - Evidence analysis tools and visualizations
  - Source citation management interface

- **Command Line Interface**: For power users and automation
  - Batch operations for evidence processing
  - Research script automation
  - System administration and maintenance

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Evidence Attribution Framework

- All assertions link to supporting evidence
- Confidence levels assigned to all data
- Source classification and evaluation
- Support for contradictory evidence
- GPS compliance tracking

### Authentication and Authorization

- Supports single-user and optional multi-user modes
- Fine-grained access control for collaborative scenarios
- Privacy filtering for living individuals
- Control over research visibility

### Version Control and Evidence Tracking

- Field-level change tracking with attribution
- Support for multiple research theories as branches
- Evidence evolution tracking over time
- Snapshot creation for stable reference points

### Data Quality and Validation

- Authority control for names, places, and sources
- Duplicate detection with configurable matching rules
- Data validation based on genealogical standards
- Historical context validation
- Evidence quality assessment

### Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for additional features
- Custom citation template support
- Scripting support for research workflows
- Webhook integration for external system notifications

## Implementation Roadmap

## Deployment Models

The system supports multiple deployment configurations:

1. **Local-First**: Primary deployment model
   - All data stored locally
   - Full functionality without internet connection
   - Optional cloud synchronization

2. **Self-Hosted Server**: For collaborative scenarios
   - Centralized data storage
   - Multi-user access with permissions
   - Web interface served from central location

3. **Hybrid Model**: Combines local and server components
   - Local data storage with server synchronization
   - Shared research repositories
   - Collaborative features with offline capability

## Technology Stack

- **Data Model**: Extended GEDCOM X conceptual model
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Databases**: Neo4j (graph) and MongoDB (document)
- **API**: GraphQL with Apollo Server and RESTful endpoints
- **Web Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **CLI**: Node.js command-line application
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with research workflow components or CLI
2. Requests routed through GraphQL API with evidence requirements
3. API layer validates requests and calls appropriate services
4. Evidence analysis services evaluate data quality and GPS compliance
5. Data persistence layer maintains evidence attribution
6. Changes tracked in version control system with source provenance
7. Results returned to user with confidence metrics and evidence quality indicators

## Security Considerations

- All data encrypted at rest
- Transport security for networked deployments
- Privacy controls for living individuals
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Regular backup procedures with evidence integrity verification

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient graph traversal for complex relationship queries
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed evidence
- Pagination and lazy loading for large evidence sets
- Batch processing for resource-intensive operations
- Optimistic UI updates with background synchronization
