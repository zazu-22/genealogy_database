As we journey to discover our ancestors, we often find ourselves researching in unfamiliar places. It's tempting to jump right in and gather whatever information we can. However, this is not necessarily the most efficient way to start research in a new area, especially if it's an area where we will be conducting a lot of research. Creating a locality guide can keep us organized, save time, and uncover valuable resources we might not have otherwise known about. 

## **What is a Locality Guide?** 

A locality guide is a comprehensive overview that contains information for researching a specific locale. Whether your focus is on a single county, state, or even a foreign country, a locality guide provides essential background information and directs you to the best resources for finding your ancestors. It is essentially a roadmap for your genealogical journey in a particular place. 

A well-constructed locality guide will typically contain: 

*   Historical background about the area 
*   Information about jurisdictions, boundary changes, and other local nuances 
*   A rundown of available records (both online and offline) 
*   Links to relevant online resources 
*   A directory of local repositories, archives, and libraries 

## **Why Are Locality Guides Important for Genealogy Research?** 

Creating a locality guide may seem like a lot of work and will take some time, but the information is essential for thoroughly researching your ancestors and will save time in the long run. This is especially true for areas you will spend a lot of time researching. Creating the guide will help you learn about research in a location you are unfamiliar with and can uncover unique resources that may not be widely known. 

Locality guides are crucial for several reasons: 

1.  **Focus Your Research:** A guide helps you focus your efforts by showing you where to look first and what records are available, avoiding searching through unrelated documents or websites. 
2.  **Save Time and Energy:** By organizing your findings in advance, you won't waste time repeatedly researching the same topics. Instead, you'll have a clear path forward with specific targeted areas. 
3.  **Uncover Local Resources:** Many genealogical resources are not widely advertised or easy to find online. By creating your own locality guide, you might discover local repositories, records, or unique collections that aren't available on mainstream genealogy websites like Ancestry or FamilySearch. 
4.  **Navigate Jurisdictional Complexities:** Boundary changes, the formation of new towns and counties, and shifting jurisdictional responsibilities can all complicate genealogical research. A good locality guide will help you understand these complexities and identify the correct records to consult. 
5.  **Preserve Knowledge for Future Use:** Once you create a locality guide, you can reuse it for future research and may even want to share it with fellow genealogists or researchers working in the same region. 

## **What Should Be Included in a Locality Guide?** 

When creating a locality guide, there is no single standard format. The purpose is to help you with your research, so it should be done in the best way for you. However, some essential parts should be included in every guide. Below is an outline of key sections that are typically found in a county-level locality guide: 

#### **A Table of Contents**

A well-organized table of contents is essential for quick navigation. This section should list the main topics in your guide and be clickable for easy access. A well-structured guide will save you time when you need to return to specific sections during the course of your research.

#### **Current Maps**

Good maps are invaluable when researching an area. Two types of maps are particularly helpful: a map showing all the jurisdictions (cities, towns, villages) located in the area and a map showing the bordering counties.

#### **Jurisdiction Information**

It is critical to have a detailed list of jurisdictions that have existed in the area over time. This should include the current and former names of cities, towns, and villages, dates of formation, consolidation, or dissolution, and any name changes.   

#### **Historical Background**

This section should offer a concise summary of the region's history, including when it was formed, boundary changes, significant events, industries or agriculture, migration patterns, and any record losses. Including a few external references or links to local history books can also be helpful. 

#### **Available Records**

One of the most critical sections of a locality guide is information on the types of records available in the area, both online and off. Create a section for each major record group. This may vary by area, but in general, the sections are: 

*   Vital Records (births, marriages, deaths) 
*   Land & Property Records (deeds, mortgages, land patents) 
*   Probate Records (wills, estates) 
*   Church Records (baptisms, marriages, burials) 
*   Newspapers (obituaries, announcements, stories) 
*   Naturalization Records (declarations, petitions, certificates) 
*   Military Records (enlistments, service records)  
*   Cemetery Records (burial lists, grave markers)
*   Maps (historical maps, land surveys)

#### ![land records info](http://www.legacytree.com/wp-content/uploads/Land-Records-blog-post-image-1024x512.png)**Repositories**

A list of local repositories with their contact information (address, phone number, email) and what records they hold. This would include government offices, libraries, and local genealogical and historical societies.

## **Tips for Creating Effective Locality Guides**  

1.  **Include a last date updated:** To keep your guide relevant, add a “last updated” date at the top of each guide. If you haven't used it in a while, it's a good idea to go through it, check links, and update what has been digitized on websites ([MyHeritage](http://www.myheritage.com), FamilySearch, Ancestry, Newspapers.com, local library, etc.). 
2.  **Create it in an Electronic Format:** Use software like Evernote, OneNote, or Word to create your guide. This allows for easy updates, the ability to include clickable links, and the convenience of searching through your document. 
3.  **Make a Template:** Using a template will save you time if you plan to create multiple locality guides. A template ensures consistency and allows you to create guides more quickly. 
4.  **Make it Interactive:** Whenever possible, use digital tools that let you include links to online resources, repositories, and digitized records. The more interactive your guide, the more valuable it will be for future research.

## **Conclusion** 

Genealogical research can lead us to unexpected places, and knowing how to research in unfamiliar regions is essential for making progress. Creating a locality guide before you begin your research can dramatically improve your efficiency, help you uncover resources you might otherwise miss, and make your research process more organized and focused. Though it may take some time and effort to compile your first guide, the payoff in terms of time saved and discoveries made will be well worth it in the long run.

    I like this idea of a “locality guide” especially for ancestral research in foreign ‘non-English’ countries that have changed significantly over the decades and centuries.
    
    For instance, in my case, what is now considered Western Ukraine, formerly eastern Galicia has undergone changes with almost every generation from medieval times to current day.

        Hello, Yaakov! It’s probably not necessary to create a locality guide for each individual ancestor. Locality Guides are best for areas where you will be conducting a lot of research over time. Hope this helps!
